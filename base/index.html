        <h3>Debt Ceiling Not So Scary to Some</h3>
        <p>
          The White House continues to issue dire warnings about the economic consequences should Congress fail to raise the debt ceiling this month. President Barack Obama told Wall Street to be "concerned" and Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said Congress is "playing with fire." But despite all the drastic pronouncements, some Republicans in Congress aren't buying it. For one thing, they doubt that October 17 is the date when the Treasury will be unable to meet its obligations. Rep. Lee Terry, R-Nebraska, is one of those lawmakers. "For him to just put out the 17th as a drop-dead date, I don't think there's a lot of credibility to that. I don't think a lot of my peers and I believe in that," Terry recently told CNN. Lew said Sunday on CNN's "State of the Union" that he has exhausted all of the "extraordinary measures" he employed when the debt limit was reached in May. "I have no more. That means that on October 17th, we'll run out of the ability to borrow," he said. He said he will have only $30 billion to pay as much as $50 billion or $60 billion worth of daily bills. Lew also warned in a recent news release that default would be "unprecedented and has the potential to be catastrophic." He said: "[C]redit markets could freeze, the value of the dollar could plummet, and U.S. interest rates could skyrocket, potentially resulting in a financial crisis and recession that could echo the events of 2008 or worse." House Speaker John Boehner demands cuts for debt limit increase. But many conservatives doubt that, too. "We don't expect there to be chaos," Terry said.
